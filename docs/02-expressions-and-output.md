# 2. Expressions and output

Use `📢` to print a value. Integers are written with keycap emoji digits and
have arbitrary precision: `1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣` means `123`. Put `.` between emoji digits
for a floating-point value: `1️⃣2️⃣.3️⃣4️⃣` means `12.34`.

```peps
📢 2️⃣ ➕ 3️⃣ ✖️ 4️⃣
📢 8️⃣ ➖ 3️⃣
📢 8️⃣ ➗ 2️⃣
📢 1️⃣.5️⃣ ➕ 2️⃣
📢 1️⃣.0️⃣ ➗ 3️⃣
```

Integer-only arithmetic keeps arbitrary precision, and integer-only division
uses integer division. If either operand is a float, Peps promotes the operation
to a 64-bit floating-point calculation. Promotion reports a runtime error when
an integer cannot be represented exactly as a float. Numeric ranges and list
indexes still require integers.

Comparisons produce `✅` or `❌`. Combine boolean values with `🤝` (and), `🔀`
(or), and `🚫` (not).

```peps
📢 5️⃣ ▶️ 3️⃣
📢 🚫 ❌ 🤝 ✅
```

Text is delimited by `💬` and can be concatenated with `➕`.

```peps
📝 🟰 💬hello💬 ➕ 💬 peps💬
📢 📝
```

Raw text literals are used while assigning or concatenating text; print the
variable that holds the resulting text rather than printing a raw literal.
